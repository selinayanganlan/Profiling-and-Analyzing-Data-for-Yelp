Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 278

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:
	no

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT id
	FROM user
	WHERE id IS NULL

	SELECT name
	FROM user
	WHERE name IS NULL

	...

	SELECT compliment_photos
	FROM user
	WHERE compliment_photos IS NULL



4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars

		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082


	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549


	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes

		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144


	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count

		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414


	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count

		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995

	,count(stars) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Beachwood'
GROUP BY stars

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns â€“ star rating and count):
+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   2.0 |     1 |
|   2.5 |     1 |
|   3.0 |     2 |
|   3.5 |     2 |
|   4.0 |     1 |
|   4.5 |     2 |
|   5.0 |     5 |
+-------+-------+



7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name
		,review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY review_count DESC limit 3

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+--------+--------------+
	| name   | review_count |
	+--------+--------------+
	| Gerald |         2000 |
	| Sara   |         1629 |
	| Yuri   |         1339 |
	+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	+----------+--------------+------+
	| name     | review_count | fans |
	+----------+--------------+------+
	| Monera   |          245 |   15 |
	| Joe      |            2 |    0 |
	| Jeb      |           57 |    0 |
	| Jed      |            8 |    0 |
	| Rae      |            2 |    0 |
	| Carolyn  |           43 |    1 |
	| Talia    |           26 |    2 |
	+----------+--------------+------+
	Posing more reviews does not directly correlate with more fans. According to the table above, Monera has more reviews thus more fans than Talia. However, Carolyn has more reviews than Talia but less fans then her. In conclusion, posing more reviews does not directly correlate with more fans, there may be other reasons affecting the number of fans.


9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	Yes. There are 1780 reviews having the word "love" but only 232 reviews having the word "hate".

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT count(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE TEXT LIKE '%love%'

	SELECT count(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE TEXT LIKE '%hate%'



10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT name
		,fans
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC limit 10

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------+
	| name      | fans |
	+-----------+------+
	| Amy       |  503 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |
	| Harald    |  311 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |
	| Christine |  173 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |
	| Cat       |  133 |
	| William   |  126 |
	| Fran      |  124 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |
	+-----------+------+



Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes.

I chose Los Vegas as the target city.

This is the distribution of hours for the businesses in Los Vegas with 2-3 stars.
+----------------------+-------+
| hours                | count |
+----------------------+-------+
| Friday|11:00-0:00    |     1 |
| Friday|8:00-22:00    |     1 |
| Monday|11:00-0:00    |     1 |
| Monday|8:00-22:00    |     1 |
| Saturday|11:00-0:00  |     1 |
| Saturday|8:00-22:00  |     1 |
| Sunday|11:00-0:00    |     1 |

| Wednesday|11:00-0:00 |     1 |
| Wednesday|8:00-22:00 |     1 |
+----------------------+-------+

This is the distribution of hours for the businesses in Los Vegas with 4-5 stars. The most popular hours is 8:00-17:00, but it doesn't appear in the businesses in Los Vegas with 2-3 stars.
+----------------------+-------+
| hours                | count |
+----------------------+-------+
| Friday|8:00-17:00    |     2 |

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes. The businesses in Los Vegas with 2-3 stars have 15265 reviews while the businesses in Los Vegas with 2-3 stars have 46952 reviews, which indicates the higher the star rating, the more reviews.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
There are 403 businesses in Los Vegas with 2-3 stars are located in NV, while there are 837 businesses in Los Vegas with 4-5 stars are located in NV and 1 located in AZ.

SQL code used for analysis:
i.
SELECT h.hours
	,count(h.hours) AS count
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE b.city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND b.stars >= 2
	AND b.stars <= 3
GROUP BY h.hours
ORDER BY count DESC

SELECT h.hours
	,count(h.hours) AS count
FROM business b
JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE b.city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND b.stars >= 4
	AND b.stars <= 5
GROUP BY h.hours
ORDER BY count DESC

ii.
SELECT sum(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND stars >= 2
	AND stars <= 3
GROUP BY city

SELECT sum(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND stars >= 4
	AND stars <= 5
GROUP BY city

iii.
SELECT STATE
	,count(STATE) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND stars >= 2
	AND stars <= 3
GROUP BY STATE
ORDER BY count DESC

SELECT STATE
	,count(STATE) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city = 'Las Vegas'
	AND stars >= 4
	AND stars <= 5
GROUP BY STATE
ORDER BY count DESC



2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

i. Difference 1:
The number of reviews for the businesses that are open is 269300, while the number of reviews for the businesses that are not open is 35261, which is less than the opened businesses.

ii. Difference 2:
There are 2590 businesses that are open in AZ, while there are only 452 businesses that are not open in AZ, which is less than the opened businesses.

SQL code used for analysis:
i.
SELECT sum(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1
GROUP BY is_open

SELECT sum(review_count)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0
GROUP BY is_open

ii.
SELECT STATE
	,count(STATE) AS count
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1
GROUP BY STATE
ORDER BY count DESC limit 3

SELECT STATE
	,count(STATE) AS count
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0
GROUP BY STATE
ORDER BY count DESC limit 3



3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Predicting the overall star rating for a business.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The star rating is the dependent variable. Number of reviews, whether it's open, attribute name and attribute value are the independent variables since they may have effect on the star rating.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-------+--------------+---------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| stars | review_count | is_open | name                     | value                                                                                                                                           |
